# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is one of the simplest design patterns in object-oriented programming.

## Key Features

- **Single Instance:** Guarantees that only one instance of the class exists.
- **Global Access:** Provides a global access point to that instance.
- **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is created only when it is first requested.


### Managing Application Settings

**Scenario:**
You have an application with global settings that need to be accessed and modified from different parts of the codebase.

- **Implementation:** Implement a `SettingsManager` class using the Singleton pattern.
- **Benefits:** Ensures all modules access the same settings instance, prevents conflicting configurations, and simplifies maintenance.

### Logging Service

**Scenario:**
You need a logging service that records application events and errors in a centralized manner.

- **Implementation:** Use a `Logger` class as a Singleton.
- **Benefits:** Facilitates consistent logging across the application, manages log outputs efficiently, and ensures logs are directed to a single instance.

### Database Connection Pool

**Scenario:**
You want to manage a pool of database connections to improve performance and resource management.

- **Implementation:** Create a `DatabaseConnectionPool` Singleton class.
- **Benefits:** Controls the number of connections, avoids the overhead of creating multiple pools, and ensures efficient utilization of database resources.
